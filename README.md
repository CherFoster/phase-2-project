# Phase 2 My Sheet Music Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

Upload and store all of your favorite sheet music in one place to be easily accessible for when you practice.

## Installation

Run <code>npm install</code> to install any dependencies, and then <code>npm start</code> to start the development server and view the app in your browser. 

The My Sheet Music App connects to a full fake REST API using a db.json file. The React app loads from <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. 

To view the data from the db.json file, open up a separate terminal and run

<code>npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000</code>. 

This will render all of the data from the json file to the browser.

You can view the db.json data by opening up <code>http://localhost:8000/musicList</code> in the browser.

Next, install the react router dom by running the command in your terminal:

<code>npm install react-router-dom</code>
